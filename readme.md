### Review:

Excellent starter course on machine learning.  Andrews style of teaching
is very refreshing.  His ability to break down topics and explain complex
topics allows a begginer to easily understand the information without
feeling overwhelmed.  The best part is he is very encouraging throughout
the course and reminds you multiple times that machine learning is 
now a tool to be used and very accesible, and no longer for just 
phds and masters students.  The lectures notes are written out with
explanations of the equations.  The programming projects are relatively
simple and breakdown the equations with a nice explanation which
make them easy to follow and implement.  Very accessible course, highly
recommended!
